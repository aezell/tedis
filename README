What is it?
-----------
Tedis is a class providing some simple tools to use when testing code that 
uses Redis as a queue.

The idea is that a user can provide a template with specially formatted
text, such that the code can do replacements in the text according to rules
given inside the placeholders.

Tedis exists because I wanted a quick and easy way to put a ton of data into 
Redis with a given format and key. I have no plans to support other backends.

Example Usage
-------------

>>> from tedis import Tedis

>>> template = "There are {{int:6}} items left in the {{ str:10 }} shopping cart{{str:15}}"
>>> tester = Tedis(server = 'localhost:6379', redis_key = 'bacon')
>>> tester.load(template, 10000)
>>> tester.dump()
>>> tester.close()

The class will then write the given number of elements to the Redis server
making each random so that testing can be more reliable.

TODO
----
- Let the user create different types of for the template itself (JSON, class, etc.).
- Let strings be alphabetical, alphanumeric, or contain punctuation.
- Make the key a class property so user can change it during the session.
