Tedis is a class providing some simple tools to use when testing code that 
uses Redis as a queue, specifically with ResQ.

The idea is that a user can provide a list of items with specially formatted
text, such that the code can do replacements in the text according to rules
given inside the placeholders.

Example Usage::
    >>> from tedis import Tedis

    >>> template = "There are {{int:6}} items left in the {{ str:10 }} shopping cart{{str:15}}"
    >>> tester = Tedis(server = 'localhost:6379', redis_key = 'bacon')
    >>> tester.load(template, 10000)
    >>> tester.dump()
    >>> tester.close()

The class will then write the given number of elements to the Redis server
making each random so that testing can be more reliable.
